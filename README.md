# Jeanalite Homepage.

This Code Institute mile stone project is intended as a homepage for the musical artist "JeanAlite". 
I wanted the site to appeal to anyone familiar with her work and to anyone just discovering her. 
To this end I tired to make it as easily as possible for anyone visiting the site to a) have ready access to various social media accounts, and b) be able to find up to date information this main site.




## Roadmap

I would like to add another page showing band merchandise when there is some.

## Credits

Credit goes to the Code Institute for their courses and W3 schools for their practical examples. 

## Acknowledgements 

I would like to thank the artist herself, JeanAlite , for her input to the design of the site, as well as the images provided for the gallery.

## Project Status

The project is marked as finished for the forseeable future.
